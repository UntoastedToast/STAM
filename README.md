# Hey we are - STAM

STAM is short forÂ **ST**reet-**A**rt-**M**ap and that's what we want to introduce you to.

We are a small group of students who share a passion for street art with a special focus on grafitis. As part of our studies of media cultural studies and media informatics at the university of cologne this project was born. Our goal is to understand our city as a museum and to appreciate the art that we encounter everywhere on the street.

We are a platform for everyone who is as passionate about streetart as we are and wants to share the art.
